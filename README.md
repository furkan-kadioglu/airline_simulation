# Airline Simulation

## 1 Description

In the previous system, there is a first come first serve queue before the
luggage hand-in counters. Whenever there is a free counter, the first person in
the queue goes to the free counter and gives their luggage. After handing in
luggage, they go into a second queue for a security check. This is also a first
come first serve queue and there are security counters. Similarly, whenever
a security counter is free, the first person in the queue goes to that counter for
the security check. 

## 2 Changes

I had 3 different ideas to make these queues more efficient. I needed
to simulate the system and collect data for 8 possible scenarios where I
implemented each of these 3 ideas or not. The first data I needed to collect is
the average time between the arrival of a passenger to the terminal and her
departure from the security check. Second data I needed to collect is the
number of passengers who are late for their flights.

1. Instead of making the queues first come, first serve I made them
first-to-fly, first serve. The person who is flight is earliest will move to
the first place of the line. This applies to both luggage hand-in queue
and security queue. I aim to reduce the number
of people who are late for their flights.
2. Airlines have a special VIP Passenger program. Each passenger
is either in this program or not. Airlines are trusting these
customers. I decided that you can make these VIP passengers skip
the security queue entirely. I hoped that this would have an
impact on other people’s waiting time as well since VIP passengers
won’t keep the security counters busy.
3. As some people do not have luggage to hand-in, you can implement
an online ticketing system. As a result, the people who do not carry
luggage can skip the first queue entirely and go in line for the security
check immediately. I hoped that this would have an impact on
other people’s waiting time as well. Since passengers without luggage
won’t keep the luggage hand-in counters busy.

This program simulates and collects the statistics for each of the 8 cases.

## 3 Input/Output Format

For this project, time will be measured in minutes. Start of the day will
be at 0 minutes. All of the given times in the input will be integers, indicating
how many minutes from the start of the day. The output is also in minutes.

### 3.1 Input Format

The first line of the input file holds 3 integers, P, LandS, number of
passengers, number of check-in counters and number of security gates.
In the following P lines, the passenger data is given, one passenger per
line. Each line holds 4 integers and 2 characters, the time at which the
passenger will arrive at the airport, the time at which the passenger has to
board her flight, the time it will take for her to hand in her luggage, the time
her security control will take and the VIP membership and luggage state of
that passenger. If the passenger is a VIP member the first character will be
a ’V’, otherwise, it will be an ’N’. Similarly, if the passenger has luggage to
hand in, the second character will be an ’L’, otherwise, it will be an ’N’.


### 3.2 Output Format

The program calculates and prints out the two statistics for each
case is given in the table in eight separate lines.

- Average waiting time for passengers.
- Number of passengers who get out of the procedure after their boarding
    time.

### 3.3 Example Input

```
8 2 2

1 10 6 3 N L

3 16 3 6 N N

4 11 2 3 V N

5 15 2 5 N N

6 9 2 1 V N

16 19 1 1 N L

17 26 3 5 N L

18 22 1 3 N L
```

- There are 8 passengers, 2 luggage counters and 2 security counters.
- The 1st passenger comes to the terminal at 1 minute. Her flight is
at 10 minutes, she will spend 6 minutes on the luggage counter and
she will spend 3 minutes on the security counter. She is not a VIP
passenger and she has luggage (She has to go to the luggage counter
even if online ticketing is implemented.).
- The 5th passenger comes to the terminal at 6 minutes. Her flight is at
9 minutes, she will spend 2 minutes on the luggage counter and she
will spend 1 minute on the security counter. She is a VIP passenger
and has no luggage. As a result, if online ticketing is implemented she
will skip the luggage counters and go straight into the security queue.
If both online ticketing and no security check for VIP passengers are
implemented she will directly board on her flight, waiting for 0 minutes
in the procedure.


### 3.4 Example Output

- 8 lines for each separate simulation cases.
- As an example, compare lines 3 and 4. These are the cases where VIP
security skip is implemented. These lines differ from the queuing rules.
You can see that making the queues first-to-fly, first serve we are effectively
reducing the average waiting time and preventing a passenger
from being late to their flight. You can see a similar trend in lines 5
and 6, where online ticketing is implemented.
- If you compare lines 4 and 8, you can also see that implementing all
the options can cause more people to miss their flights. This happens
because the passengers 2 and 4 skip the luggage queue and fill both
security counters. They end up blocking passenger 1 from proceeding
with the security check and cause her to miss her flight.


## 4 Implementation Details

1. Variable limits are as follows:
    - 1 ≤P≤5,
    - 1 ≤L, S≤ 20
    - 1 ≤All the times given in minutes≤50,
2. The execution time limit is 1 second.
3. Even if a passenger is already late to their flight they will still stay in
the queues. I do not put people out of the procedure based on this.
4. I assumed that no two passengers will arrive at the terminal
at the same time or leave luggage counters at the same time.
5. If two different events say a passenger leaving a luggage counter and
another passenger leaving a security counter, is happening at the same
time, the person leaving the luggage counter can occupy the security
counter that was emptied by the other passenger in that instant. The same
thing applies for a passenger arriving at the terminal and another passenger
leaving a luggage counter at the same time. I ensured this by making sure
that you simulate simultaneous events in
this order:

    1. A passenger leaving a security counter.
    2. A passenger leaving a luggage counter.
    3. A passenger arriving at the terminal.
